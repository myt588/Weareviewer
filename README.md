Google Street View VR + GeoGuessor


First Commit accomplishes a functionality close to a basic 360 degree photo viewer.
Two methods are used to accomplish the same functionality.
However, both approaches have flaws at the very top angle and very bottom angle. 
Maybe change to a different 360 photo can solve this issue.
